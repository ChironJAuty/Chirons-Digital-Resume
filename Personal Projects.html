				<h2><center>During a period of unemployment, I honed my skills in web development, 
				teaching myself HTML and CSS while creating websites for friends. Recently, an 
				individual who had helped steer me in the right direction during my teenage years 
				reached out to me, knowing of my passion for technology, and asked me to create a 
				website to raise awareness for men suffering from depression. This individual runs a 
				camp in Caloola Farm to help men get back on their feet, and I saw this as an opportunity 
				to put my skills to good use. While I had previous experience with WordPress, I realized 
				that creating a website on this platform would be costly, and given my current financial 
				situation, it wasn't feasible. So, I made the decision to teach myself HTML and CSS to create 
				a website from scratch. What started out as a way to help someone in need has now turned into 
				a hobby of mine. I am grateful for the opportunity to have helped someone while also improving 
				my skills in web development.</h2></center>
